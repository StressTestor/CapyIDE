# Contribution Style and Safety

- Match the existing TypeScript style: explicit types for public APIs, early returns, small functions, and clear naming.
- Prefer multi-line readability over dense one-liners; avoid unrelated reformatting in edits.
- For Electron/VS Code code paths, keep platform abstractions intact and avoid importing Node-only modules into browser layers.
- Security:
  - Keep local-only features (memory/metrics) private by default; opt-in telemetry only.
  - Do not introduce file/network side effects without a setting or user action.
  - Keep secrets in OS keychain/DPAPI; avoid plaintext in repo.
- Tests: add or update unit/integration tests when changing core behaviors.
